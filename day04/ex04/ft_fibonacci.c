// Create a function ft_fibonacci that returns the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence, the first element being at the 0 index.
// Weâ€™ll consider that the Fibonacci sequence starts like this: 0, 1, 1, 2.
// Obviously, ft_fibonacci has to be recursive.
// If the index is less than 0, the function should return -1.

// The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:
// 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

// The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
// The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)
// The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2), And the 5 is (2+3)

// The Fibonacci numbers are generated by setting F0=0, F1=1, and then using the recursive formula
// Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
